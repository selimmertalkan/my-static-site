title: "About Me"
---

I’m a technology enthusiast with a strong focus on Cloud Computing, DevOps, and Automation. I’m passionate about exploring how modern cloud platforms and automation tools can streamline workflows, enhance scalability, and deliver efficient solutions.

I share my knowledge through English-based content on YouTube, helping others understand and adopt these technologies with clarity and practicality.

Currently, I’m building my expertise in Microsoft Azure, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform), and automation with PowerShell, while deepening my understanding of DevOps practices. My goal is to create impactful solutions that bridge the gap between technology and real-world needs.
